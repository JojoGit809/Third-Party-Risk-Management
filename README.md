# Third-Party-Risk-Management


This lab simulates a**Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)** workflow used in GRC teams to assess vendors for **SOC 2**, **ISO 27001**, **HIPAA**, and **PCI DSS** considerations.

It’s designed to look like real work output: **intake → due diligence → risk scoring → findings → remediation → decision → monitoring**.

---

## What this lab demonstrates

- Building and maintaining a **vendor inventory**
- Running a structured **vendor intake**
- Performing **inherent risk** and **residual risk** scoring
- Writing **findings** and tracking remediation
- Documenting **risk acceptance / exceptions**
- Mapping vendor controls to common frameworks:
  - **SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria**
  - **ISO/IEC 27001** (Annex A control areas)
  - **HIPAA Security Rule safeguards** (administrative/physical/technical)
  - **PCI DSS** (for payment data handling)
